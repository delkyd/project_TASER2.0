#Three Amigos Search Exploration Resource...popularly known as [ TASER ] 

##Project - Build [ TASER ]

[ TASER ] is a website that allows a user to input a search term once and see how the rest of the world interacts with and perceives that term.  Specifically, once a search term is input we will populate a page with images, tweets, and audio/visuals that will create a 360 degree experience for our user.  

###Strategy  

Connect to the following APIs in order to create this rich search experience for our user:  

- Flickr - to access and use pictures
- YouTube - to access and use audio/video files
- Twitter - to access text-based tweets   

###User Stories

1. A user will find the [ TASER ] website
2. A user will create a new account, setting up email and password
3. A user will login with username and password
4. A user will start a new [ TASER ] search
5. A user will search on a word or term
6. A user will wait for his TASER page to populate
7. A user will view the populated TASER site from all three API sources
9. A user can clear their TASER search page and start a new TASER search
10. A user can have their life changed by this incredible new way to approach the search experience

###Models   
 There are two models:  
 
1. User model
